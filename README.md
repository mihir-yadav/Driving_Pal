# Driving_Pal
Most of the accidents are caused by one of these two reasons- the driver dozed while driving or he/she got distracted. As a step towards road safety, I decided to create a drowsiness detector using openCV and dlib which would monitor the eyes of the vehicle driver and activate a sound alarm if he dozes during driving.Even if he is not dozing, but is feeling sleepy, he should be warned.To do so, I decided to also monitor his mouth, if he yawns, then remind him to stop nearby for a coffee.
Determining whether the driver is distracted is what we do next. First we load the haar cascade frontal face and eye classifier to get roi.Then with the help of keras' img_to_array function we convert roi in to an array and compare it with the result predicted by the model obtained from keras' load_model function.If this probability is less than 0.5 then we conclude the driver is distracted and warn him, otherwise let him enjoy the ride.
