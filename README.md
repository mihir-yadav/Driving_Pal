Many of the accidents that occur on a highway are because the driver dozed while driving. As a step towards road safety, I decided to create a drowsiness detector using openCV and dlib which would monitor the eyes of the vehicle driver and activate a sound alarm if he dozes during driving.Even if he is not dozing, but is feeling sleepy, he should be warned.To do so, I decided to also monitor his mouth, if he yawns, then remind him to stop nearby for a coffee.
