we’ll be monitoring the eye aspect ratio to see if the value falls but does not increase again, thus implying that the person has closed their eyes.
Algorithm for facial_landmark detector:
Its alternate in opencv is Facemark

This method starts by using:

1)    A training set of labeled facial landmarks on an image. These images are manually labeled, specifying specific (x, y)-coordinates of regions surrounding each facial structure.
2)    Priors, of more specifically, the probability on distance between pairs of input pixels.

Given this training data, an ensemble of regression trees are trained to estimate the facial landmark positions directly from the pixel intensities themselves (i.e., no “feature extraction” is taking place).
This would return a shape object (collection of coordinates for the all landmarks ).
with the help of this we get location of eyes which we convert to a np array of 12 ordered pairs indicating the locations of the 2 eyes	.

we then evaluate eye aspect ratio as (V1+V2)/(2*H) for each eye and then avg of them.

Our drowsiness detector hinged on two important computer vision techniques:

    Facial landmark detection
    Eye aspect ratio

Facial landmark prediction is the process of localizing key facial structures on a face, including the eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, and jawline.

Specifically, in the context of drowsiness detection, we only needed the eye regions (I provide more detail on how to extract each facial structure from a face here).

Once we have our eye regions, we can apply the eye aspect ratio to determine if the eyes are closed. If the eyes have been closed for a sufficiently long enough period of time, we can assume the user is at risk of falling asleep and sound an alarm to grab their attention.

differnece in dlib and opencv
    DLib is a C++ library/toolkit with python API that contains machine learning algorithms, including computer vision.
    OpenCV is a C/C++ library wth python API of functions dealing with real-time computer vision.
